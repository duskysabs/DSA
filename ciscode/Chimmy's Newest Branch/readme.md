Chimmy, a yogurt brand in the Philippines, has just opened up its newest branch in Il Corso, Cebu.

Since the shop is popular, customers line up quickly to place their orders. The manager decided to use a queue system to handle the flow of customers.

You are asked to write a program that simulates the customer queue for Chimmy. The program must use a circular queue with sacrificial space to store customers.
